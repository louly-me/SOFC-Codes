# SOFC-Codes
This repository contains a Python script for modeling and simulating key electrochemical losses in a Solid Oxide fuel cell. These calculations are used to analyze and optimize fuel cell performance under various operating conditions.

## Key Parameters
Reaction kinetics (e.g., transfer coefficients, reaction orders, activation energies)
Structural properties (e.g., porosity, tortuosity)
Operating conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, gas composition)

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Libraries: numpy, scipy, math, thermo, 

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/louly-me/SOFC-Codes.git
   cd SOFC-Codes
   
2. **Run the script**
   Modify input parameters (e.g., temperature, pressures, gas composition) in the code as needed, then execute:
   ```bash
   python <script_name>.py
